              <h3>My childhood</h3>
              <p>
                In second grade, I finally figured out that something was wrong with me. There always had been, and it was only getting worse. For as long as I had been alive, I was never like other kids. As a baby, I never crawled more than a few inches. But one day, just for fun, my dad stood me up across the room from my mom. "Walk to Mama,‚Äù he told me. Despite all expectations, I did. I got up and walked to Mama. I didn 't even stumble. It wasn 't that I couldn 't walk, I just hadn 't needed to. My mom carried me everywhere. It was a sign, albeit missed, of what was to come. I had also never spoken, not even baby babble. Many of my parents ' friends took this as proof that I was autistic.

              <h3>My education</h3>
              <p>
                Then my school education began. My first school was Adarsh Montessori School, Pahar Ganj where I completed my lower kindergarten education (LKG). After that I admitted in St. Anthony Girls Senior Secondary School, Pahar Ganj where I completed my upper kindergarten education (UKG).Later on I got admission in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Rohini. In this school I admitted in class I and studied till class XII. I was always sured about my career that I wanted to be a Doctor so that I chose medical stream so that I could fulfill my dreams.

              <h3>My family</h3>
              <p>
                I was born and raised into a hardworking family that are the complete opposite of culture alienators. My siblings and I are all first generation in America on my mom's side and second generation on my dad's side. Life was very hard for my parents to raise all seven of us and depended on my grandparents for most of their help. Being that my grandparents brought all nine of their kids to America from Belize it was also very hard for them so survive and find stability. Most families that come to America from a third world country usually find it very difficult to keep up family traditions and sometimes lose all contact. My family found a way to stay very close and keep the Belizean culture very alive still to this day.
